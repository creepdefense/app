# decay = at which % from the center of the impact area the damage will decay eventually to zero at the edges.
#         with aoe 100 and decay 0.75, the damage will start to decay at aoe 75 and at the very edges the damage is lowest.
#         EXCEPTION: with decay 0.0, the damage does not decay at all! Same applies to decay 1.0, since the decay starts at the edges and ends to edges.
# slowM = slow multiplier, how much speed is decreased from the creep speed when hit with slow effect. 
#         if creep speed = 200 and slowM = 0.3, then the creep will move with 200-(200*0.3) = 140 speed.
#         if no slow effect, this value should be set to zero, however slowT value tells the game if the tower has slow effect or not.
# slowT = slow time, how long will the slow effect last. if zero, then the tower has no slowing effect at all.
# splash = will it give insta splash damage when shot? you have to define aoe to make this work! note: rockets cannot have this feature enabled.
# NO_UPG = a tower cannot be upgraded anymore.
